# Testing of host components

The hosting layer of .NET Core consists of several native libraries and executables (entirely written in C++). The full end to end features sometimes require code in the `coreclr` repo, but testing of that is outside of the code of this document. For description of the various hosting components, please see [host-components](host-components.md).
